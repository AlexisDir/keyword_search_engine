# Keyword search engine (with Python on OS)

This code allows you to search for keywords in a local text database.  
Following the Russian doll principle, it is possible to determine the order of appearance of keywords and thus make a set of selections and sub-selections.  
For example, files with keyword A (or/and keyword A´) can be selected provided that keyword B (or/and keyword B´) is also present.  
Selection 1: all files  
Sub-selection 2: file with keyword A (or/and keyword A´)  
Sub-selection 3: file with keyword A and B (or/and keyword B´)  

For each keyword, the code displays the name of the file concerned and the extracts of text containing the keyword(s).  

Finally, the code ends with a report on the number and percentage of occurrences.
